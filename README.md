![Demo Screenshot](<Screenshot (12).png>)

## Features

- **Natural Language Interface**: Ask questions about your data in plain English
- **Automated Visualizations**: Generate charts and graphs based on your queries
- **Data Insights**: Get AI-powered summaries and analysis of your datasets
- **Interactive Experience**: Conversation-based UI for intuitive data exploration
- **Powered by Hugging Face**: Leverage state-of-the-art language models for analysis

## Quick Start

### Online Demo

You can try the application directly on [Streamlit Cloud](https://conversational-data-explorer.streamlit.app).

### Local Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conversational-data-explorer.git
   cd conversational-data-explorer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Hugging Face API token:
   Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with the following content:

   ```toml
   HF_API_TOKEN = "your_hugging_face_api_token"
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage Guide

1. **Upload Data**: Start by uploading a CSV file using the file uploader in the sidebar
2. **Review Summary**: The app will automatically generate a summary of your data
3. **Ask Questions**: Use the chat interface to ask questions about your data
4. **Explore Results**: View visualizations, statistics, and insights generated by the AI

### Example Queries

- "Show me a histogram of age distribution"
- "What's the correlation between salary and experience?"
- "Create a scatter plot of X vs Y"
- "Find outliers in the dataset"
- "Summarize the key statistics"

## Configuration

### Model Selection

You can select from several Hugging Face models in the sidebar:

- mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (Default)
- meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
- google/gemma-7b-it
- microsoft/phi-2

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Hugging Face Hub client

## Deployment

### Streamlit Cloud

This app is configured for easy deployment on Streamlit Cloud:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Connect your repository to Streamlit Cloud
3. Add your Hugging Face API token as a secret in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard
4. Deploy the app

### Hugging Face Spaces

To deploy on Hugging Face Spaces:

1. Create a new Space on Hugging Face
2. Connect your GitHub repository or upload files directly
3. Add your API token as a secret in the Space settings
4. Configure the Space to use Streamlit

## Architecture

The application consists of several key components:

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Handles CSV file uploads and initial data analysis
- **NLP Interface**: Processes natural language queries using Hugging Face models
- **Visualization Engine**: Generates appropriate charts based on data and queries
- **Conversation Management**: Maintains context throughout the user session

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Token Errors**:

   - Ensure your Hugging Face API token is valid and has sufficient permissions
   - Check that you've correctly set up the token in secrets.toml or cloud environment variables

2. **Model Access Issues**:

   - Some models may require specific access permissions from Hugging Face
   - Try using different models if you encounter permission errors

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Larger datasets may cause performance issues
   - Consider sampling or filtering your data for better performance
